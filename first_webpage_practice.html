      <p>
        I have always wanted to code and this
         is exactly what I have imagined myself doing,
         I am very excited to see how this turns out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will try and introduce myself as the code runs on.
         Practicing everything that I have learned thus far.

        This section will describe my hobbies and interests.
    </h2>
      <p> I enjoy gaming, biking, movies, and spending as much time with my fiancee as possible.
        I also have 2 cats, Lola and Meeko, whom I love very much. I don't have much spare time, but when I do it is dedicated to futhering
        my coding knowledge and abilities...or eating.
